# AierTeam

This project leverages advanced AI technologies to provide users with a cognitive personal assistant. It is compatible on Windows 10/11.
The purpose of this project is to overcome the limitation of current windows automation tools which heavily rely on software API. 
This project ensures a comprehensive simulation of human interactions with the computer, thereby maximizing the capabilities of next-generation Windows automation and personal assistance.
We are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with automation technology. By providing an open-source solution that significantly augments productivity, we aim to set new standards in personal and professional productivity tools.
